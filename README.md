# Butler-I3D-Club
This Github serves the ButlerCC i3D club, a student group.

You can download a copy of all files by clicking the "Download as ZIP" button on the right, and if you want to make changes, you can click the "Clone in Desktop" button right above it.

If you are adding a Unity project, please ensure that all Library, Temp, and Build folders are ignored. 

It is a best practice to make changes to your own branch (which you can create as many as you need) and then merge those changes back into the master branch. Please be very descriptive in your Commit changes description.
